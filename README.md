# Atalay Ã–zmen's Resume Website

A personal resume website integrated with a visitor counter, showcasing the use of AWS services.

## Development Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Created `index.html` with the basic structure of the resume.
   - Styled the website using `style.css` to achieve a clean and modern layout.

2. **Visitor Counter Integration**
   - Added a visitor counter section in `index.html` to display the number of visits.
   - Implemented the counter functionality using `script.js`, which increases and retrieves the visitor count using an AWS Lambda function.

3. **AWS Services Configuration**
   - **DynamoDB**: Set up a DynamoDB table to store and manage the visitor count.
   - **AWS Lambda**: Set up a Lambda function to handle incrementing and retrieving the visitor count from DynamoDB.

4. **CI/CD**
   - Each time I change my resume and push my changes to GitHub, I want the changes to automatically reflect on my website. Updated files should be uploaded to S3, and CloudFront distribution should be invalidated.
   - For this, I used GitHub actions that uses my newly created IAM users access key.
   - Since I need to give GitHub actions the permission to upload files into my S3 bucket, I had to create a new IAM user for it. It needs programmatic access, so it uses Access Key as the credential type.
   - To my new IAM user, I attached my own custom created policy that enables updating, deleting and listing the objects for my bucket.


## Technologies Used
